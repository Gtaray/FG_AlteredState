# Altered State
Fantasy Grounds extension for Index Card RPG supporting the cyberpunk setting Altered State.

This extension modifies the following: 
* Base effort types to match those of Altered State, adding GUN and HEALING effort.
* Re-organizing the PC sheet to accept both skin and consciousness
* Adds Surge and Rage options to the PC sheet. Both of which accept dragging and dropping dice to and from their fields.
* Adds 'cybernetic' as a new state for items to be in, in  addition to carried and equipped.

## Compatibility
This extension is currently incompatible with the Quickstart 2e extension, 
as both extensions modify the base effort types. It is compatible with all other extensions, however.
